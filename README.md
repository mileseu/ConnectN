ConnectN Assignment

This was an assignment for my first module in Computer Science; Principles of Programming, a first foray into programming and Java.  
  
Some key lessons learnt here were Object-Oriented Programming:  
  Encapsulation — private instance variable and public accessor methods.  
  Abstract - a concept or idea which is not associated with any particular instance.  
  Inheritances - expresses “is-a” and/or “has-a” relationship between two objects.  
  Polymorphism - means one name many forms. It is further of two types — static and dynamic.
